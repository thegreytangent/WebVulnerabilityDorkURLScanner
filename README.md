## Web Vulnerability Dork URL Scanner


### Description:
The Web Vulnerability Dork URL Scanner is a tool designed for educational purposes that enables users to identify potentially vulnerable websites based on search engine dorks. Dorks are search queries entered into search engines (such as Google) that can reveal information about potentially vulnerable systems on the internet. The tool parses these search results to identify and list URLs that could be prone to certain vulnerabilities.


### Features:
* Search Query Input: Allows users to input custom search dorks.
* Multiple Search Engines: Supports scanning across multiple popular search engines.
* URL Extraction: Efficiently extracts and lists potentially vulnerable URLs.
* User-Friendly Interface: Provides an easy-to-use command-line interface.

### Uses:
The primary use of the Web Vulnerability Dork URL Scanner is for educational and research purposes. It serves as a demonstration of how search engines can be leveraged to discover potentially vulnerable websites, which can be invaluable for:

* Security Researchers: To understand how attackers might find and target vulnerable sites.
* Students: Studying cybersecurity to grasp the concept of dorks and their potential implications.
* Web Administrators: To become aware of the importance of securing their sites and ensuring they aren't easily discoverable with simple dorks.
